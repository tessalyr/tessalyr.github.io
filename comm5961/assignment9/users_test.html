        <h2>Qualitive Test Using Wireframe</h2><br>
        <p>To see how visitors will actually use my site, I conducted a five users usability study with the wireframes of my website. I invited five volunteers who are in accordance with my target audience to accomplish the usability test. Those “users” are all young females at their early twenties and have the experience of watching Disney princess movies.
            In order to get better insight into my website design and identify the majority of my usability issues, I divide testing sessions into testing phase and post-testing phase, with four questions about actual operation for the first phase and another three questions about the whole user experience for the second phase. Below are the questions:
        </p>
        <h4>Testing Questions:</h4>
        <p>Q1. How can you get basic information about Disney princesses?</p>
        <p>Q2. How can you watch the Disney live-action remake Aladdin?</p>
        <p>Q3. How do you find the way to see princesses in Disneyland?</p>
        <p>Q4. How do you select a princess doll for a little sister?</p>
        <h4>Post-Testing Questions:</h4>
        <p>Q5. Is the navigation and layout clear enough? If not, which part confuses you?</p>
        <p>Q6. Which part do you think need to be improved?</p>
        <p>Q7. Are there any other functions or contents you expect to see on this website?</p>
        <br>
        <p>  I conducted the test with a computer to imitate the real user flow, and let my volunteers move mouse around as what they would do in a normal website. In addition, before starting the test, I told the participants that I would record a screencast just for my own review, so they didn’t need to be pressured. I also told them all they need to do was to think aloud during the test and tell the truth about their genuine feelings. Below are the summaries of five users’ feedback. </p>
        <p>  For the testing phase, all four questions aimed to let users accomplish some most basic tasks through navigating the website on their own. I, meanwhile, observed how they clicked on the wireframes to complete the test. In general, all the five volunteers successfully achieved four tasks in very short time. As I observed, the participants moved their mouse straightforward throughout the website and then found corresponding functions quickly and accurately. What they said when navigating the website were basically “maybe I can find it in the navigation bar”, “I’ll go back to the navbar”, “I think I can click here” and “that’s clear”. Both their word and action revealed that the website did well in the navigation system, which was very helpful for them in getting information. There was only one exception that user2 felt a little confused about the data table shown in the movies page, but this would be no longer a problem when the data is imported into the table actually.</p>
        <p>  For the post-testing phase, all the five participants appraised the navigation and layout of the website as clear, logical and easy to use, which could basically validate simpleness and clearness of my website. In the meantime, five users offered valuable comments and recommendations from diverse perspectives to the site. User1 pointed out that the website lacked an overview at the very beginning, which made her confused before opening the following pages, hence I added a group of navigation buttons to the entry page. On top of that, she also mentioned a function of voting for favorite princess, which I might consider adding later. User2 and user3 separately told me their expectations for my website, which were latest news of princess and selfie function using princess filters. As for the latest news, I agreed with user2 and rethought my contents arrangement, then, I changed the banner in homepage from simple carousel style photos to images with latest news. Actually, I was also interested in the proposal of selfie function, but it was beyond my ability, so I had to put it aside. User4 argued that the huge banner in theme park page is unnecessary as the map below seemed to be more important, besides, she suggested me to add a tour guides section. I thought her suggestion was rational because tour guides could coordinate well with the map. As to user5, the only problem she referred to was that a simple black-white wireframe couldn’t display the authentic effect, which would be solved when the website has been established practically.</p>
        <p>  After summarizing all my findings through the usability test process, I prioritized the recommendations based on those findings and made a new version of my website wireframe. Figures above are the modified version.</p>
